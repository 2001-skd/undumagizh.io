# undumagizh.io
Undu Magizh is a simple React web app to discover and bookmark recipes. While building it, I learned reusable components, fetching APIs, controlled vs uncontrolled components, lifting state up, Redux for global state (avoiding prop drilling), routing with dynamic paths and errors, and lazy loading.
